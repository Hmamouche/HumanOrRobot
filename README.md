## Introduction
This repository contains the data and the code for reproducing the results of the paper:
__Listen and tell me who the user is talking to: Automatic detection of
the interlocutorâ€™s type during a conversation__.
Only the intermediate extracted features from raw data that are available in this repository as described in the paper. To have the raw data, i.e., conversational multimodal signals of 25 subjects, please contact us.

## Training - the case of the LSTM model

- Using linguistic features:
```bash
python src/train_models.py -t ling -m lstm
```

- Using filter banks features
```bash
python src/train_models.py -t ling -m lstm
```
- __Remarque__: use python src/train_models.py -h to train more models.

## Testing - the case of the LSTM model

- Usinglinguistic features
```bash
python src/test_models.py -t ling -m lstm
```

- Using filter banks features
```bash
python src/test_models.py -t ling -m lstm
```
